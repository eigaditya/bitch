    <h2>DAILY LIFE OF A SEAL OR SWCC</h2>
  <p>There is no typical "day at the office". Sea, Air, Land (SEAL) and Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewman (SWCC) operators constantly learn, improve and refine their skills working with their teammates. Their office transcends international boundaries, the extremes of geography and the spectrum of conflict. A SWCC operator's day usually includes physical training to ensure they maintain peak fitness levels as well as whatever training and operations are required of their particular unit.</p>
  <h2>TIME WITH FAMILY</h2>
  <p>SWCC and SEAL operators spend a great deal of time training for war and deploying overseas. The training and operational tempo can be high, but operators do have room in their busy schedules for family time, including 30 days of leave per year. </p>
  <h2>DUTY STATIONS</h2>
  <p>SEALs are usually assigned to homeports at Naval Base Coronado, CA and Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek/Fort Story, VA. Additional locations oversea are also available.</p> 
  <p>SWCC are assigned to Naval Base Coronado, CA and Little Creek/Fort Story, VA as well as Stennis, MS. Further assignments are applied per needs of the Navy, Special Operations Command, and Combatant Commanders.
  </p>
  <h2>PLATFORMS</h2>
  <p>SWCC operate a variety of small boats and craft, including the SOC-R (Special Operations Craft – Riverine), and three types of Combat Craft (Assault, Medium, and Heavy). SEALs employ the mini-submersible SDV (SEAL Delivery Vehicle) and CRRC (Combat Rubber Raiding Craft). SEALs also operate a variety of land-based ground mobility vehicles, including the armored HMMWV (High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle).</p>
  <h2>WEAPONS SYSTEMS</h2>
  <p>SEAL and SWCC operators are trained on a variety of small arms and heavy weapons, including pistols, rifles, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket and missile launchers, grenades and explosives, but the most valuable weapons system is the operator.</p>
  <h2>SECURITY CLEARANCE</h2>
  <p>Both SWCC and SEAL operators are required to maintain a minimum security clearance of Secret. Background security investigations are conducted by agents of DCSA (Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency). The process may include a personal interview of the candidate, family members and contacts along with a questionnaire. A credit bureau report and criminal background investigation are part of the process. Felonies, high credit risk due to substantial debt, foreign contacts and other factors may pose a challenge to obtaining a clearance. Applicants may address questions to their recruiters or chain of command as appropriate.</p>
  <h2>APPLICATION/FLEET TRANSFER</h2>
  <p>See the steps on how to <a href="navy-seal-swcc-apply-main.html" target="_self">apply</a> to become a SEAL or SWCC. For additional questions about how to become a SEAL or SWCC, see the Naval Special Warfare (NSW) Enlisted Community Manager website or NSW Officer Community Manager website. </p>
  <h2>PAY AND BENEFITS</h2>
  <p>Navy SEAL and SWCC operators are paid twice a month and receive <a href="https://www.tricare.mil/" target="_self">health care</a> <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> for themselves and family members, low-cost <a href="https://www.va.gov/life-insurance/options-eligibility/sgli/" target="_self">life insurance</a>, <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>and many other benefits. <a href="https://www.navy.com/joining-the-navy/enlistment-bonuses" target="_self">Bonuses</a> <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> and special pays may apply in addition to <a href="https://www.navy.com/what-to-expect/military-pay" target="_self">basic pay</a> <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> and allowances. The Navy offers financial assistance for College Loan repayment, Undergraduate Degree Programs and Graduate Degree Programs. These benefits allow each operator to contribute to their community, family and country. Here’s a quick summary:
  <ol>
  <li>Starting pay of up to $60,000</li>
  <li>Bonuses for becoming qualified and for re-enlisting</li>
  <li>Possible repayment of college loans</li>
  <li>Extra pay for diving, parachuting and demolitions</li>
  <li>30 days vacation per year</li>
  <li>Medical and dental benefits</li>
  <li>Retirement after 20 years</li>
  <li>Tax free pay in combat zones</li>
  <li>Tax free allowances for housing and food</li>
  <li>Access to military facilities</li>
  </ol>
  </p>
  <h2>HISTORY</h2>
  <p>The Navy SEAL Teams and the Special Boat Teams trace their lineage to World War II.</p>
  <h2>NSW MENTORS</h2>
  <p>Mentors are contracted by Navy Recruiting Command to assist recruiters with physically developing potential enlisted SEAL or SWCC candidates. They teach proper methods of working out to achieve maximum results on the Physical Screening Test. Once they are satisfied that a candidate exceeds requirements, they forward their endorsement to Recruiting Command and the candidate is considered for selection. There are 26 NSW Mentors who work with uniformed NSW Coordinators and Navy recruiters across the nation. To access an NSW Mentor, a SEAL or SWCC candidate must first pass basic eligibility requirements with a Navy recruiter.</p>

  <h4>By: Anton Myrer</h4>
  <p>1968 war novel by American author Anton Myrer.

Myrer wrote his novel to warn against ambition without principle and the military-industrial complex. Sam Damon and Courtney Massengale are the vehicles for this warning. Damon is an honorable soldier who rises in rank by success in field command. He is a soldier of character with his men's welfare in mind. Massengale has no honor and rises in rank through staff positions by cunning and political connections. He is driven by lust for power and cares nothing for the welfare of soldiers.

  <h3>The Killer Angels</h3>
  <h4>By: Michael Shaara</h4>
  <p>In the four most bloody and courageous days of our nation’s history, two armies fought for two conflicting dreams. One dreamed of freedom, the other of a way of life. Far more than rifles and bullets were carried into battle. There were memories. There were promises. There was love. And far more than men fell on those Pennsylvania fields. Bright futures, untested innocence, and pristine beauty were also the casualties of war. Michael Shaara’s Pulitzer Prize–winning masterpiece is unique, sweeping, unforgettable—the dramatic story of the battleground for America’s destiny.

  <h4>By: Malcolm Gladwell</h4>
  <p>Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant-in the blink of an eye-that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work-in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others?

Along the way he explains the secrets of software billionaires, what it takes to be a great soccer player, why Asians are good at math, and what made the Beatles the greatest rock band.

  <h3>Dancing on the Heads of Snakes</h3>
  <h4>By: Victoria Clark</h4>
  <p>Yemen is the dark horse of the Middle East. Every so often it enters the headlines for one alarming reason or another—links with Al-Qaeda, kidnapped Westerners, explosive population growth—then sinks into obscurity again. But, as Victoria Clark argues in this riveting book, we ignore Yemen at our peril. The poorest state in the Arab world, it is still dominated by its tribal makeup and has become a perfect breeding ground for insurgent and terrorist movements.
</p>
  <h3>Haunted by Chaos: China's Grand Strategy from Mao Zedong to Xi Jinping</h3>
  <h4>By: Sulmaan Wasif Khan</h4>

  <h3>Ghost Fleet</h3>
  <h4>By: P.W. Singer</h4>
  <p>The United States, China, and Russia eye each other across a twenty-first century version of the Cold War, which suddenly heats up at sea, on land, in the air, in outer space, and in cyberspace. The fighting involves everything from stealthy robotic–drone strikes to old warships from the navy’s “ghost fleet.” Fighter pilots unleash a Pearl Harbor–style attack; American veterans become low-tech insurgents; teenage hackers battle in digital playgrounds; Silicon Valley billionaires mobilize for cyber-war; and a serial killer carries out her own vendetta. Ultimately, victory will depend on blending the lessons of the past with the weapons of the future.
